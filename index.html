                        Hi there! I am Yashik, a junior at Cupertino High School. Ever since this pandemic started I 
                        have seen many educational opportunities go to ashes. I was wondering how I could contribute to 
                        my community as citizen. I was gonna use my extra time to help other students succeed in 
                        my expertise. As for my credentials, I have been aspiring to become an engineer + business
                        major in college so math has always been a knack for me. I have gotten A+, passing with flying colors, 
                        and even recommended by my Algebra 1 math teacher to tutor students. 
                    </p>
